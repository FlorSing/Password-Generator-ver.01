# Password-Generator-ver.01
a random password generator

Hi.

This is a web-based GUI that can be used to genrate a random password.

The password will be gnerated using javascript and syled on the web using HTML and CSS.

It is based on a set of criteria or choices by the user, namely:
  - the length of password -- 10-64 characters,
  - character types to be included, such as:
      - lowercase,
      - uppercase,
      - numeric, and
      - special characters.

Improvements will be made through the creation process.

A sample web app looks like this:

Thank you.
